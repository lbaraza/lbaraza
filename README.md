# Toman Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves an analysis conducted for Toman Bike Share to determine if increasing prices next year is feasible.
As a data analyst,the focus was on examining current and historical data to provide insights for pricing decisions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Used for data extraction,transformation,and loading (ETL) processes.
- **Power BI**: Utilized for data visualization and dashboard creation to present findings.

## Objectives

1. Analyze current and historical usage data.
2. Identify trends and patterns in bike usage.
3. Assess the impact of current pricing on demand.  
4. Provide data-driven recommendations for potential price changes.

## Key Findings

- Detailed analysis of peak usage times, customer demographics, and revenue streams.
- Visualization of trends showing usage patterns.
- Insights into customer sensitivity to pricing changes.

## Data Sources

- Toman Bike Share usage data (e.g., trip records, customer information).
- Financial data including revenue and costs.

## Usage

1. **SQL Scripts**: Located in the `sql` directory, containing scripts used for data extraction and transformation.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: Located in the `powerbi` directory, showcasing the interactive dashboard created for the analysis.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of Toman Bike Share's current performance and 
supports informed decision-making regarding potential price adjustments.
