# Toman Bike Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves an analysis conducted for Toman Bike Share to determine if increasing prices next year is feasible.
As a data analyst,the focus was on examining current and historical data to provide insights for pricing decisions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Used for data extraction,transformation,and loading (ETL) processes.
- **Power BI**: Utilized for data visualization and dashboard creation to present findings.

## Objectives

1. Hourly revenue Analysis.
2. Profit and revenue trends.
3. Seasonal Revenue.  
4. Rider demographics.
5. Provide recommendations on raising prices next year.

## Key Findings
-  Conservative Increase: Considering the substantial increase last year,a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop.An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market's response without risking a significant loss of customers.
-  Price Setting: If the price in 2022 was $4.99,a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49, while a 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.

## Data Sources
You can access the datasets through the following links:

-  https://github.com/lbaraza/SQL-Power-BI/blob/main/bike_share_yr_0.csv
-  https://github.com/lbaraza/SQL-Power-BI/blob/main/bike_share_yr_1.csv
-  https://github.com/lbaraza/SQL-Power-BI/blob/main/cost_table.csv

## Usage

1. **SQL Scripts**: Located in the `sql` directory, containing scripts used for data extraction and transformation.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: Located in the `powerbi` directory, showcasing the interactive dashboard created for the analysis.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of Toman Bike Share's current performance and 
supports informed decision-making regarding potential price adjustments.
